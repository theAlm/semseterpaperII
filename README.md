Abstract

This semester paper gives the preparatory work for a numerical approximation of Poissonâ€™s equation with a Dirichlet boundary condition
in two dimensions. A mixed finite element approach is applied to the primal-dual coupling problem. Conforming bilinear lowest-order
Raviart-Thomas elements are imposed on the primal domain and conforming triangular linear finite elements on the dual domain. Basis
functions of both finite element spaces and the stiffness matrix elements are derived. Applying the virtual gap technique the basis is
scaled in order to maintain a well-posed linear system. The focus is on deriving all formula in order to implement the method in a straight
forward manner in the MATLAB finite element toolbox LehrFEM.
